# ðŸŽ®Â Mario Jump

## ðŸŽ™ Introduction

The idea of the project become from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9buAwVBDhA&ab_channel=ManualdoDev) and I made some improvements like a score, clouds stop when lost game and add sounds.

The principal motivation was my younger brother Gabriel, he has 4 years old and he love games and make one for him was incredible.

I asked if he liked and he said thought it was really cool and fun, he helped me with some ideas of improvements. The incredible thing was to see him interact with friends on the street who in the end asked to play.

These attitudes that motivate me to always continue studying and improving in the development world, seeing things that are simple for me becoming incredible for other people.

Probably this is the first game of many others I will make for him ðŸ˜œ
